### Intro
Manufacturers with less-than-stellar ERP systems still have a need to analyse inventory levels
and create build plans that are achievable and optimized. With sufficient access to the bill
of material (BOM) for each desired completed product to be built, it is possible to create
analyses that summarise needs and optimize plans based on current and future inventory levels.

### Requirements
To create analyses of this format, the following are required:

* List of demand of completed products with their respective SKUs, either true demand or a theoretical.

* BOM for each completed product of interest. A product's BOM should have a list of every component
 that goes into building the completed product.
 
* Master lists of on-hand and on-order inventory levels for components.
 
### Methodology
At a high level, we will be combining BOMs, aggregating the components and summarising by demand
for completed products. The packages `tidyverse` and `lpSolve` will be used. I have also created a file 
called `bom_generator.R` that creates a 15 imaginary BOMs of finished products, each having 40 components
with quantities per build assigned.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lpSolve)
source('bom_generator.R')
```

The way that BOMs are outputted from an ERP system / data source may vary significantly. The BOM
examples I've created are very simplistic - component code, quantity required per build of the 
finished product, and whether the component is made or purchased. Your BOMs may have other important
variables to include. 

In this example, let's say you are able to retrieve one BOM at a time from your data source as a
.csv file. The file name is the finished product SKU. For our analysis, we will need to read all
the BOMs for the products of interest into a single table. If the BOMs are contained in a folder
called `rand_boms` that is a sub-folder of our working directory, this can be accomplished by the
following:

```{r}
files <- fs::dir_ls("rand_boms")

files |> 
  map_dfr(~ read_csv(.x, col_types = cols('c', 'd', 'f')), .id = "source") |> 
  slice_head(n = 5)
  
```

In the above code chunk, we've read all the BOM .csv files in `rand_boms` and appended them into a 
single table by use of the `purrr::map_dfr` function. Notice that the `source` column includes
the full file path. We will want to have the SKU as its own variable by doing the following:

```{r}
files |> 
  map_dfr(~ read_csv(.x, col_types = cols('c', 'd', 'f')), .id = "source") |>
  mutate(sku = str_extract(source, r"(\d{5})")) |> 
  select(sku, item_code, qty, src) ->
  clean_boms

clean_boms |> 
  slice_head(n = 5)

```
