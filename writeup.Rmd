### Intro
Manufacturers with less-than-stellar ERP systems still have a need to analyse inventory levels
and create build plans that are achievable and optimized. With sufficient access to the bill
of material (BOM) for each desired completed product to be built, it is possible to create
analyses that summarise needs and optimize plans based on current and future inventory levels.

### Requirements
To create analyses of this format, the following are required:

* List of demand of completed products with their respective SKUs, either true demand or a theoretical.

* BOM for each completed product of interest. A product's BOM should have a list of every component
 that goes into building the completed product.
 
* Master lists of on-hand and on-order inventory levels for components.
